# IDA Pro Custom Theme

Painfully cribbed from full [IDA darcula theme](https://draculatheme.com/ida)

Place in your `IDA_USER/themes/jags_theme` directory, then select from the Options -> Colors drop down menu.
Fixes, improvements, etc, welcome. :)

### Things I haven't figured out how to fix (help very much welcome!)
- ~~Buggy graph background colors~~ FIXED
- ~~Consistent background for the top bar~~ FIXED
- Can't fix hover over drag menu
- Can't change color of console
	- This may be an IDA 8.2 error (the color resets when applied).
- Can't change color of navbar or it breaks the whole thing
